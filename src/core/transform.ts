// The Transform law: what a Pokémon becomes when it copies another one whole (Ditto's
// Imposter, Mew's Transform, Zoroark's… no — that one's a disguise, see illusion.ts).
//
// Transform is not a forme change. A forme change swaps the body and keeps the Pokémon:
// Meloetta-Pirouette still has Meloetta's EVs, level and spread, and the calc derives its
// stats the ordinary way once it knows the forme. Transform swaps the Pokémon and keeps
// almost nothing — the sim copies the target's FINAL stat numbers verbatim
// (`Pokemon.transformInto`, sim/pokemon.ts: `this.storedStats[stat] = pokemon.storedStats[stat]`),
// not the spread that produced them. So a Ditto that copies a level-77 Dragapult carries
// Dragapult's level-77 stats around at its OWN level 87 — and the damage formula reads the
// ATTACKER's level, so the copy hits harder than the Pokémon it copied.
//
// What it keeps: level, HP (the one stat never copied), item, status, boosts, and its own
// identity for the information game — a transformed Ditto is still a Ditto running the
// Ditto set, and that is what the sets view must go on saying.
//
// Pure: no DOM, no network, no @smogon/calc. The numbers arrive already computed, because
// only the shell can resolve the target (see `LiveFacts.transformedInto`).
